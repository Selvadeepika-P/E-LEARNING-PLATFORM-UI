This project is a front-end design for an E-Learning platform that provides a structured and visually appealing interface for online learners. The HTML file organizes the website into multiple sections, including a header with a site title and navigation bar, a course listing area displaying various learning tracks, a progress tracking section using native HTML progress bars, and a video embedding area that allows users to preview course content directly within the page. The style.css file enhances the websiteâ€™s appearance with a modern, clean aesthetic using a soft background color, responsive layout, and hover effects on course cards for interactivity. The design leverages Flexbox for responsiveness, ensuring that the course cards wrap neatly across different screen sizes. A fixed color scheme with a primary blue header creates strong visual hierarchy and maintains brand consistency. Overall, the platform is designed to be intuitive, engaging, and adaptable for students accessing content on desktop or mobile devices, making it an ideal front-end foundation for a complete e-learning system.
